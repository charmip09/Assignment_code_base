Dictionary 

The Python dictionary makes it easier to read and change data, thereby rendering it more actionable for predictive modeling. A Python dictionary is an unordered collection of data values. Unlike other data types that hold only one value as an element, a Python dictionary holds a key: value pair.

How to Order by in Dictionary-
To sort a dictionary by value in Python you can use the sorted() function. Python's sorted() function can be used to sort dictionaries by key, which allows for a custom sorting method.

A dictionary maps a set of objects (keys) to another set of objects (values) so you can create an unordered list of objects.
Dictionaries are mutable, which means they can be changed.
Dictionaries are mutable, which means they can be changed.
Dictionaries are unordered, so the order that the keys are added doesnâ€™t necessarily reflect what order they may be reported back. Because of this, you can refer to a value by its key name
